## I'm IvÃ¡n PÃ©rez ðŸ˜„, a student of Computer Science with a strong interest in technology and game development. ðŸ‘‹

Some of my most important projects include:

### Web Recruitment Application with Gamified Interview 
*ASP .NET, API, C, Unity, UI/UX designer, Game designer, Game developer, Graphic designer*

We develop a web application for [ATOS](https://atos.net/en/) that enables job applicants to submit their Curriculum Vitae (CV) through an interview-style video game created in Unity, which will produce a standardized format for all registered CVs. The application will utilize an API to store the data in a corresponding MySQL database.

### [Game Never Ending Story](https://gallery-games.itch.io/never-ending-story)
*Unity, C, Game designer, Game developer, Level desingner, UI/UX designer*

We developed a 2D platformer video game entirely in Unity, in collaboration with graphic and sound designers. We designed and developed each of the game mechanics in the C programming language. In addition, we created our own user interface, taking into account the user experience. We ensured that the interface was intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for players.

### Optimizing Traffic Flow through Agent-based Simulation
*Unity, 3D Modelling, C, Python*

We have developed a multi-agent system in collaboration with [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) aimed at enhancing the traffic flow in a roundabout and creating a redesign proposal for it. The entire project was executed in Unity, utilizing 3D models to represent the scenario. Python Flask and iPython Notebook were employed to carry out the calculations for each of the agents, which can be read in Unity via a JSON file.

### Volunteer Management IOS Application
*Swift, UI/UX designer, API*

We created two IOS applications for [CÃ¡ritas de Monterrey](https://www.caritas.org.mx) using Swift Xcode and a dedicated MySQL database to register and manage volunteering for a company. The applications streamline the process and provide a user-friendly experience for volunteers and administrators. The use of a dedicated database ensures data security and reliability. The two applications we developed have a strong focus on security, utilizing a UFW firewall, SSL certificates allowing for HTTPS protocol, Environment Variables, Secure Headers, and Logging for the API. These measures were implemented to ensure the safety and privacy of volunteer data, protecting against potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
