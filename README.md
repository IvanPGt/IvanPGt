## I'm IvÃ¡n PÃ©rez ðŸ˜„, a student of Computer Science with a strong interest in technology. ðŸ‘‹

Some of my most important projects include:

### Web Recruitment Application with Gamified Interview 
*ASP .NET, API, C, Unity, UI/UX designer, Game designer, Game developer, Graphic designer*

We develop a web application that enables job applicants to submit their Curriculum Vitae (CV) through an interview-style video game created in Unity, which will produce a standardized format for all registered CVs. The application will utilize an API to store the data in a corresponding MySQL database.

### Game Never Ending Story
*Unity, C, Game designer, Game developer, Level desingner, UI/UX designer*

We developed a 2D platformer video game entirely in Unity, in collaboration with graphic and sound designers. We designed and developed each of the game mechanics in the C programming language. In addition, we created our own user interface, taking into account the user experience. We ensured that the interface was intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for players.

### Optimizing Traffic Flow through Agent-based Simulation
*Unity, 3D Modelling, C, Python*
